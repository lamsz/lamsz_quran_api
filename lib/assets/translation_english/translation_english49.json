For them is forgiveness and a great reward.", "Verily, those who call you from behind the dwellings, most of them have no sense.", "And if they had patience till you could come out to them, it would have been better for them. And Allah is Forgiving, Most Merciful.", "O you who believe! If a rebellious evil person comes to you with a news, verify it, lest you harm people in ignorance, and afterwards you become regretful to what you have done.", "And know that among you there is the Messenger of Allah. If he were to obey you in much of the matter, you would surely be in trouble, but Allah has endeared the faith to you and has beautified it in your hearts, and has made disbelief, Fusuq and `Isyan hateful to you.
