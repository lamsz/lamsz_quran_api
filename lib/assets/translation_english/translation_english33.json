Neither has He made your wives whom you declare to be like your mothers' backs, your real mothers nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons. That is but your saying with your mouths. But Allah says the truth, and He guides to the way.", "Call them by their fathers, that is more just with Allah. But if you know not their father's, your brothers in faith and Mawalikum (your freed servants). And there is no sin on you concerning that in which you made a mistake, except in regard to what your hearts deliberately intend. And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.", "The Prophet is closer to the believers than themselves, and his wives are their mothers. And blood relations among each other have closer personal ties in the decree of Allah than the believers and the Muhajirin, except that you do kindness to those brothers. This has been written in the Book.", "And when We took from the Prophets their covenant, and from you, and from Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa, and `Isa son of Maryam. We took from them a strong covenant.", "That He may ask the truthful about their truth. And He has prepared for the disbelievers a painful torment.", "O you who believe!

There is no postition for you. Therefore go back!\" And a band of them ask for permission of the Prophet saying: \"Truly, our homes lie open.\" And they lay not open. They but wished to flee.", "And if the enemy had entered from all sides, and they had been exhorted to Al-Fitnah, they would surely have committed it and would have hesitated thereupon but little.", "And indeed they had already made a covenant with Allah not to turn their backs, and a covenant with Allah must be answered for.", "Say: \"Flight will not avail you if you flee from death or killing and then you will enjoy no more than a little while!\"", "Say: \"Who is he who can protect you from Allah if He intends to harm you, or intends mercy on you\" And they will not find, besides Allah, for themselves any protector or any helper.", "Allah already knows those among you who keep back (men) from fighting (in Allah's cause), and those who say to their brethren, \"Come here towards us,\" while they come not to the battle except a little,", "Being miserly towards you. Then when fear comes, you will see them looking to you, their eyes revolving like one over whom hovers death; but when the fear departs, they will smite you with sharp tongues, miserly towards good.

Whoever of you commits an open Fahishah, the torment for her will be doubled, and that is ever easy for Allah.", "And whosoever of you is obedient to Allah and His Messenger, and does righteous good deeds, We shall give her, her reward twice over, and We have prepared for her a noble provision.", "O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women. If you keep you have Taqwa, then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire, but speak in an honorable manner.", "And stay in your houses, and do not Tabarruj yourselves like the Tabarruj of the times of ignorance, and perform the Salah, and give Zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger.

And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed into a plain error.", "And (remember) when you said to him on whom Allah has bestowed grace and you have done a favor: \"Keep your wife to yourself, and have Taqwa of Allah.\" But you did hide in yourself that which Allah will make manifest, you did fear the people whereas Allah had a better right that you should fear Him. So, when Zayd had completed his aim with her, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them. And Allah's command must be fulfilled.", "There is no blame on the Prophet in that which Allah has made legal for him. That has been Allah's way with those who have passed away of old.

When you marry believing women, and then divorce them before you have sexual intercourse with them, no `Iddah have you to count in respect of them. So, give them a present, and set them free in a handsome manner.", "O Prophet! Verily, We have made lawful to you your wives, to whom you have paid their due (dowery), and those (slaves) whom your right hand possesses -- whom Allah has given to you, and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who migrated with you, and a believing woman if she offers herself to the Prophet, and the Prophet wishes to marry her -- a privilege for you only, not for the (rest of) the believers. Indeed We know what We have enjoined upon them about their wives and those (slaves) whom their right hands possess, in order that there should be no difficulty on you.

Enter not the Prophet's houses, unless permission is given to you for a meal, (and then) not (so early as) to wait for its preparation. But when you are invited, enter, and when you have taken your meal, disperse without sitting for a talk. Verily, such (behavior) annoys the Prophet, and he is shy of (asking) you (to go); but Allah is not shy of (telling you) the truth. And when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts. And it is not (right) for you that you should annoy Allah's Messenger, nor that you should ever marry his wives after him (his death). Verily, with Allah that shall be an enormity.", "Whether you reveal anything or conceal it, verily, Allah is Ever All-Knower of everything.", "It is no sin on them before their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their brother's sons, or the sons of their sisters, or their own (believing) women, or their (female) slaves.

Send your Salah on him, and greet him with Taslim.", "Verily, those who annoy Allah and His Messenger, Allah has cursed them in this world and in the Hereafter, and has prepared for them a humiliating torment.", "And those who annoy believing men and women undeservedly, they bear the crime of slander and plain sin.", "O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their Jalabib over their bodies. That will be better that they should be known so as not to be annoyed. And Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.", "If the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease, and those who spread false news among the people in Al-Madinah stop not, We shall certainly let you overpower them, then they will not be able to stay in it as your neighbors but a little while.", "Accursed, they shall be seized wherever found, and killed with a (terrible) slaughter.", "That was the way of Allah in the case of those who passed away of old, and you will not find any change in the way of Allah.", "People ask you concerning the Hour, say: \"The knowledge of it is with Allah only. What do you know It may be that the Hour is near!\"", "Verily, Allah has cursed the disbelievers, and has prepared for them a flaming Fire.", "Wherein they will abide forever, and they will find neither a a protector nor a helper.", "On the Day when their faces will be turned over in the Fire, they will say: \"Oh, would that we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Messenger.\"", "And they will say: \"Our Lord! Verily, we obeyed our chiefs and our great ones, and they misled us from the way.\"", "\"Our Lord! Give them double torment and curse them with a mighty curse!\"", "O you who believe! Be not like those who annoyed Musa, but Allah cleared him of that which they alleged, and he was honorable before Allah.", "O you who believe! Have Taqwa of Allah and speak (always) the truth.", "He will direct you to do righteous good deeds and will forgive you your sins. And whosoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed achieved a great victory.", "Truly, We did offer the Amanah to the heavens and the earth, and the mountains, but they declined to bear it and were afraid of it. But man bore it. Verily, he was unjust and ignorant.", "So that Allah will punish the hypocrites, men and women, and the men and women who are idolators.
