        "By the star when it goes down.",
        "Your companion has neither gone astray nor has he erred.",
        "Nor does he speak of desire.",
        "It is only a revelation revealed.",
        "He has been taught by one mighty in power.",
        "Dhu Mirrah then he Istawa.",
        "While he was in the highest part of the horizon,",
        "Then he approached and came closer,",
        "And was at a distance of two bows' length or less.",
        "So (Allah) revealed to His servant whatever He revealed.",
        "The heart lied not in what he saw.",

        "That indeed is a division most unfair!",
        "They are but names which you have named - you and your fathers - for which Allah has sent down no authority. They follow but a guess and that which they themselves desire, whereas there has surely come to them the guidance from their Lord!",
        "Or shall man have what he wishes",
        "But to Allah belongs the last (Hereafter) and the first (the world).",
