You see them bowing falling down prostrate, seeking reward from Allah and acceptance. The mark of them is on their faces from the traces of prostration. This is their description in the Tawrah.

Allah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous good deeds, forgiveness and a mighty reward." ] }
