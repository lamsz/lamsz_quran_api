        "Alif Lam Mim.",
        "The revelation of the Book in which there is no doubt, is from the Lord of all that exists.",
        "Or say they: \"He has fabricated it\" Nay, it is the truth from your Lord, so that you may warn a people to whom no warner has come before you, in order that they may be guided.",
        "Allah it is He Who has created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them in six Days. Then He Istawa over the Throne. You have none, besides Him, as a protector or an intercessor. Will you not then remember",
        "He directs the command from the heavens to the earth; then it will go up to Him, in one Day, the space whereof is a thousand years of your reckoning.",
        "That is He, the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen, the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.",
        "Who made everything He has created good and He began the creation of man from clay.",
        "Then He made his offspring from semen of despised water.",
        "Then He fashioned him in due proportion, and breathed into him the soul; and He gave you hearing, sight and the sense of deduction. Little is the thanks you give!",
        "And they say: \"When we are lost in the earth, shall we indeed be created anew\" Nay, but they deny the meeting with their Lord!",
        "Say: \"The angel of death, who is set over you, will take your souls. Then you shall be brought to your Lord.\"",
        "And if you only could see when the criminals shall hang their heads before their Lord (saying): \"Our Lord! We have now seen and heard, so send us back that we will do righteous good deeds. Verily, we now believe with certainty.\"",
        "And if We had willed, surely We would have given every person his guidance, but the Word from Me took effect, that I will fill Hell with Jinn and mankind together.",
        "Then taste because of your forgetting the meeting of this Day of yours. Surely, We too will forget you, so taste you the abiding torment for what you used to do.",
        "Only those believe in Our Ayat, who, when they are reminded of them, fall down prostrate, and glorify the praises of their Lord, and they are not proud.",
        "Their sides forsake their beds, to invoke their Lord in fear and hope, and they spend out of what We have bestowed on them.",
        "No person knows what is kept hidden for them of delights of eyes as a reward for what they used to do.",
        "Is then he who is a believer like him who is rebellious Not equal are they.",
        "As for those who believe and do righteous good deeds, for them are Gardens of Abode as an entertainment for what they used to do.",
        "And as for those who rebel, their abode will be the Fire, every time they wish to get away therefrom, they will be put back thereto, and it will be said to them: \"Taste you the torment of the Fire which you used to deny.\"",
        "And verily, We will make them taste of the near lighter torment prior to the greater torment, in order that they may return.",
        "And who does more wrong than he who is reminded of the Ayat of his Lord, then turns aside therefrom Verily, We shall exact retribution from the criminals.",
        "And indeed We gave Musa the Scripture. So, be not you in doubt of meeting him. And We made it a guide to the Children of Israel.",
        "And We made from among them, leaders, giving guidance under Our command, when they were patient and used to believe with certainty in Our Ayat.",
        "Verily, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection, concerning that wherein they used to differ.",
        "Is it not a guidance for them: how many generations We have destroyed before them in whose dwellings they do walk about Verily, therein indeed are signs. Would they not then listen",
        "Have they not seen how We drive water to the dry land that has no vegetation, and therewith bring forth crops providing food for their cattle and themselves Will they not then see",
        "They say: \"When will this Fath be, if you are telling the truth\"",
        "Say: \"On the Day of Al-Fath, no profit will it be to those who disbelieve if they (then) believe! Nor will they be granted a respite.\"",
        "So turn aside from them and await, verily, they (too) are awaiting."
