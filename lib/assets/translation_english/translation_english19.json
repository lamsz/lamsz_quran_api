        "Kaf Ha Ya `Ain Sad.",
        "A reminder of the mercy of your Lord to His servant Zakariyya.",
        "When he called his Lord [with] a call in secret.",
        "He said: \"My Lord! Indeed my bones have grown feeble, and gray hair has Ashta`al on my head, and I have never been unblessed in my invocation to You, O my Lord!\"",
        "\"And verily, I fear Mawali after me, and my wife is barren. So give me from Yourself an heir.\"",
        "\"Who shall inherit me, and inherit (also) the posterity of Ya`qub. And make him, my Lord, one with whom You are well-pleased!\"",
        "(Allah said:) \"O Zakariyya! Verily, We give you the good news of a son, whose name will be Yahya. We have given that name to none before (him).\"",
        "He said: \"My Lord! How can I have a son, when my wife is barren, and I have reached the extreme old age.\"",
        "He said: \"Thus your Lord says: `It is easy for Me. Certainly I have created you before, when you had been nothing!\"') [19:8-9]",
        "He [Zakariyya] said: \"My Lord! Appoint for me a sign.\" He said: \"Your sign is that you shall not speak unto mankind for three nights, though having no bodily defect.\"",
        "Then he came out to his people from the Mihrab and he indicated to them by signs to glorify [Allah] in the morning and in the afternoon.",
        "(It was said to his son): \"O Yahya! Hold fast to the Scripture.\" And We gave him wisdom while yet a child.",
        "And Hananan from Us, and Zakatan, and he was pious,",
        "And dutiful to his parents, and he was not arrogant or disobedient.",
        "And Salam (peace) be on him the day he was born, and the day he dies, and the day he will be raised up to life (again)!",
        "And mention in the Book, Maryam, when she withdrew in seclusion from her family to place facing east.",
        "She placed a screen before them; then We sent to her Our Ruh, and he appeared before her in the form of a man in all respects.",
        "She said: \"Verily, I seek refuge with the Most Gracious (Allah) from you, if you do fear Allah.\"",
        "(The angel) said: \"I am only a messenger from your Lord, (to announce) to you the gift of a righteous son.\"",
        "She said: \"How can I have a son when no man has touched me, nor am I Baghiyya\"",
        "He said: \"Thus says your Lord: `That is easy for Me (Allah). And (We wish) to appoint him as a sign to mankind and a mercy from Us (Allah), and it is a matter (already) decreed (by Allah).\"'",
        "So she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a remote place.",
        "And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a date palm. She said: \"Would that I had died before this, and had been forgotten and out of sight!\"",
        "Then he cried unto her from below her, saying: \"Grieve not: your Lord has provided a Sariy under you.\"",
        "\"And shake the trunk of date palm towards you, it will let fall fresh ripe dates upon you.\"",
        "\"So eat and drink and rejoice. And if you see any human being, say: `Verily, I have vowed a fast for the Most Gracious so I shall not speak to any human being today.,\"",
        "Then she brought him to her people, carrying him. They said: \"O Mary! Indeed you have brought a thing Fariy.\"",
        "\"O sister of Harun! Your father was not a man who used to commit adultery, nor your mother was an unchaste woman.\"",
        "Then she pointed to him. They said: \"How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle\"",
        "He said: \"Verily, I am a servant of Allah, He has given me the Scripture and made me a Prophet;\"",
        "\"And He has made me blessed wherever I be, and has enjoined on me [Awsani] Salah and Zakah, as long as I live.\"",
        "\"And to be dutiful to my mother, and made me not arrogant, unblessed.\"",
        "\"And Salam (peace) be upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive!\"",
        "Such is `Isa, son of Maryam. Qawlal-Haqq [it is a statement of truth] about which they doubt (or dispute).",
        "It befits not (the majesty of) Allah that He should beget a son. Glorified be He. When He decrees a thing, He only says to it: \"Be!\" -- and it is.",
        "[`Isa said]: \"And verily, Allah is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him. That is the straight path.\"",
        "Then the sects differed, so woe unto the disbelievers from the meeting of a great Day.",
        "How clearly will they see and hear, the Day when they will appear before Us! But the wrongdoers today are in plain error.",
        "And warn them of the Day of grief and regrets, when the case has been decided, while (now) they are in a state of carelessness, and they believe not.",
        "Verily, We will inherit the earth and whatsoever is thereon. And to Us they all shall be returned.",
        "And mention in the Book, Ibrahim. Verily, he was a man of truth, a Prophet.",
        "When he said to his father: \"O my father! Why do you worship that which hears not, sees not and cannot avail you in anything\"",
        "\"O my father! Verily, there has come to me the knowledge of that which came not unto you. So follow me, I will guide you to the straight path.\"",
        "\"O my father! Worship not Shaytan. Verily, Shaytan has been a rebel against the Most Gracious.\"",
        "\"O my father! Verily, I fear lest a torment from the Most Gracious should overtake you, so that you become a companion of Shaytan.\"",
        "He (the father) said: \"Do you revile my gods, O Ibrahim If you stop not (this), I will La'arjumannak. So get away from me Maliyan.\"",
        "Ibrahim said: \"Peace be on you! I will ask forgiveness of my Lord for you. Verily, He is unto me Hafiyyan.",
        "And I shall turn away from you and from those whom you invoke besides Allah. And I shall call upon my Lord, and I certainly hope that I shall not be unblessed in my invocation to my Lord.\"",
        "So when he had turned away from them and from those whom they worshipped besides Allah, We gave him Ishaq and Ya`qub, and each one of them We made a Prophet.",
        "And We gave them of Our mercy, and We granted them Sidqin `Aliyyan on the tongues.",
        "And mention in the Book, Musa. Verily, he was Mukhlasan and he was a Messenger, (and) a Prophet.",
        "And We called him from the right side of the Mount (Tur), and made him draw near to Us for a talk with him.",
        "And We granted him his brother Harun, (also) a Prophet, out of Our mercy.",
        "And mention in the Book, Isma`il. Verily, he was true to what he promised, and he was a Messenger, (and) a Prophet.",
        "And he would enjoin on his family and his people the Salah and the Zakah, and his Lord was pleased with him.",
        "And mention in the Book, Idris. Verily, he was a man of truth, (and) a Prophet.",
        "And We raised him to a high station.",
        "Those were they unto whom Allah bestowed His grace from among the Prophets, of the offspring of Adam, and of those whom We carried (in the ship) with Nuh, and of the offspring of Ibrahim and Israel, and from among those whom We guided and chose. When the Ayat of the Most Gracious were recited unto them, they fell down prostrate and weeping.",
        "Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have lost the Salah and have followed lusts. So they will meet Ghaiy.",
        "Except those who repent and believe, and work righteousness. Such will enter Paradise and they will not be wronged in aught.",
        "(They will enter) `Adn Gardens which the Most Gracious has promised to His servants in the unseen. Verily, His promise must come to pass.",
        "They shall not hear therein any Laghw, but only Salam. And they will have therein their sustenance, morning and afternoon.",
        "Such is the Paradise which We shall give as an inheritance to those of Our servants who had Taqwa.",
        "And we descend not except by the command of your Lord. To Him belongs what is before us and what is behind us, and what is between those two; and your Lord is never forgetful.",
        "Lord of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, so worship Him and abide patiently in His worship. Do you know of any who is similar to Him",
        "And man says: \"When I am dead, shall I then be raised up alive\"",
        "Does not man remember that We created him before, while he was nothing",
        "So by your Lord, surely We shall gather them together, and (also) the Shayatin, then We shall bring them round Hell, Jithyya.",
        "Then indeed We shall drag out from every sect all those who were worst in obstinate rebellion against the Most Gracious.",
        "Then, verily, We know best those who are most worthy of being burnt therein.",
        "There is not one of you but will pass over it (Hell); this is with your Lord, a decree which must be accomplished.",
        "Then We shall save those who had Taqwa. And We shall leave the wrongdoers in it, Jithiyya.",
        "And when Our clear Ayat are recited to them, those who disbelieve say to those who believe: \"Which of the two groups has the best dwellings and the finest Nadiyyan\"",
        "And how many a generation have We destroyed before them, who were better in wealth, goods and outward appearance",
        "Say: whoever is in error, the Most Gracious will extend [circumstances] for him, until, when they see that which they were promised, either the torment or the Hour, they will come to know who is worst in position, and who is weaker in forces.",
        "And Allah increases in guidance those who walk aright. And the righteous good deeds that last are better with your Lord for reward and better for resort.",
        "Have you seen him who disbelieved in Our Ayat and said: \"I shall certainly be given wealth and children [if I live again].\"",
        "Has he known the Unseen or has he taken a covenant from the Most Gracious",
        "Nay, We shall record what he says, and We shall increase his torment;",
        "And We shall inherit from him all that he speaks of, and he shall come to Us alone.",
        "And they have taken gods besides Allah, that they might give them honor, power and glory.",
        "Nay, but they will deny their worship of them, and will become their adversaries.",
        "See you not that We have sent the Shayatin against the disbelievers to push them to do evil.",
        "So make no haste against them; We only count out to them a (limited) number.",
        "The Day We shall gather those with Taqwa unto the Most Gracious (Allah), like a delegation.",
        "And We shall drive the criminals to Hell, in a thirsty state.",
        "None shall have the power of intercession, but such a one as has received permission (or promise) from the Most Gracious (Allah).",
        "And they say: \"The Most Gracious (Allah) has begotten a son.\"",
        "Indeed you have brought forth (said) a thing Idda.",
        "Whereby the heavens are almost torn, and the earth is split asunder, and the mountains Hadda.",
        "That they ascribe a son to the Most Gracious.",
        "But it is not suitable for the Most Gracious that He should beget a son.",
        "There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Gracious as a slave.",
        "Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting.",
        "And everyone of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection.",
        "Verily, those who believe and work deeds of righteousness, the Most Gracious will bestow love for them.",
        "So, We have made this easy in your own tongue, only that you may give glad tidings to those who have Taqwa, and warn with it the people that are Ludda.",
        "And how many a generation before them have We destroyed! Can you find a single one of them or hear even a whisper of them"
