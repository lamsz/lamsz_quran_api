(This is) a Book which We have revealed unto you in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness into light by their Lord's leave to the path of the Almighty, the Praised.", "Allah to Whom belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth! And woe unto the disbelievers from a severe torment.", "Those who prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter, and hinder (men) from the path of Allah and seek crookedness therein - they are far astray.", "And We sent not a Messenger except with the language of his people, in order that he might make (the Message) clear for them. Then Allah misleads whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.", "And indeed We sent Musa with Our Ayat (saying): \"Bring out your people from darkness into light, and remind them of the annals (or days) of Allah. Truly, therein are Ayat for every patient, thankful (person).\"", "And (remember) when Musa said to his people: \"Call to mind Allah's favor to you, when He delivered you from Fir`awn's people who were afflicting you with horrible torment, and were slaughtering your sons and letting your women live; and in it was a tremendous trial from your Lord.\"", "And (remember) when your Lord proclaimed: \"If you give thanks, I will give you more; but if you are thankless, verily, My punishment is indeed severe.\"", "And Musa said: \"If you disbelieve, you and all on earth together, then verily, Allah is Rich (free of all needs), Worthy of all praise.\"", "Has not the news reached you, of those before you, the people of Nuh, `Ad, and Thamud And those after them None knows them but Allah. To them came their Messengers with clear proofs, but they put their hands in their mouths and said: \"Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent, and we are really in grave doubt as to that to which you invite us.\"", "Their Messengers said: \"(What!) Can there be a doubt about Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth He calls you that He may forgive you of your sins and give you respite for a term appointed.\" They said: \"You are no more than human beings like us! You wish to turn us away from what our fathers used to worship. Then bring us a clear authority.\"", "Their Messengers said to them: \"We are no more than human beings like you, but Allah bestows His grace to whom He wills of His servants. It is not ours to bring you an authority (proof) except by the permission of Allah. And in Allah (alone) let the believers put their trust.\"", "\"And why should we not put our trust in Allah while He indeed has guided us in our ways And we shall certainly bear with patience all the hurt you may cause us, and in Allah (alone) let those who trust, put their trust.\"", "And those who disbelieved, said to their Messengers: \"Surely, we shall drive you out of our land, or you shall return to our religion.\" So their Lord revealed to them: \"Truly, We shall destroy the wrongdoers.\"", "\"And indeed, We shall make you dwell in the land after them. This is for him who fears standing before Me and also fears My threat.\"", "And they sought victory and help; and every obstinate, arrogant dictator (who refuses to believe in the Oneness of Allah) was brought to a complete loss and destruction.", "In front of him is Hell, and he will be made to drink boiling, festering water.", "He will sip it unwillingly, and he will find great difficulty in swallowing it down his throat, and death will come to him from every side, yet he will not die, and in front of him, will be a great torment.", "The parable of those who disbelieved in their Lord is that their works are as ashes, on which the wind blows furiously on a stormy day; they shall not be able to get aught of what they have earned. That is the straying, far away (from the right path).", "Do you not see that Allah has created the heavens and the earth with truth If He wills, He can remove you and bring (in your place) a new creation!", "And for Allah that is not hard or difficult.", "And they all shall appear before Allah; then the weak will say to those who were arrogant: \"Verily, we were following you; can you avail us anything against Allah's torment\" They will say: \"Had Allah guided us, we would have guided you. It makes no difference to us (now) whether we rage, or bear (these torments) with patience; there is no place of refuge for us.\"", "And Shaytan will say when the matter has been decided: \"Verily, Allah promised you a promise of truth. And I too promised you, but I betrayed you. I had no authority over you except that I called you, and you responded to me. So blame me not, but blame yourselves. I cannot help you, nor can you help me. I deny your former act in associating me (Shaytan) as a partner with Allah (by obeying me in the life of the world). Verily, there is a painful torment for the wrongdoers.\"", "And those who believed and did righteous deeds, will be made to enter Gardens under which rivers flow, - to dwell therein for ever (i.e. in Paradise), with the permission of their Lord. Their greeting therein will be: \"Salam (peace!).\"", "See you not how Allah sets forth a parable A goodly word as a goodly tree, whose root is firmly fixed, and its branches (reach) to the sky.", "Giving its fruit at all times, by the leave of its Lord, and Allah sets forth parables for mankind in order that they may remember.", "And the parable of an evil word is that of an evil tree uprooted from the surface of earth, having no stability.", "Allah will keep firm those who believe, with the word that stands firm in this world, and in the Hereafter. And Allah will cause the wrongdoers to go astray, and Allah does what He wills.", "Have you not seen those who have changed the blessings of Allah into disbelief (by denying Prophet Muhammad and his Message of Islam), and caused their people to dwell in the house of destruction", "Hell, in which they will burn, - and what an evil place to settle in!", "And they set up rivals to Allah, to mislead (men) from His path! Say: \"Enjoy (your brief life)! But certainly, your destination is the (Hell) Fire!\"", "Say to My servants who have believed, that they should perform the Salah, and spend (in charity) out of the sustenance We have given them, secretly and openly, before the coming of a Day on which there will be neither mutual bargaining nor befriending.", "Allah is He Who has created the heavens and the earth and sends down water (rain) from the sky, and thereby brought forth fruits as provision for you; and He has made the ships to be of service to you, that they may sail through the sea by His command; and He has made rivers (also) to be of service to you.", "And He has made the sun and the moon, both constantly pursuing their courses, to be of service to you; and He has made the night and the day to be of service to you.", "And He gave you of all that you asked for, and if you [try to] count the blessings of Allah, never will you be able to count them. Verily, man is indeed an extreme wrongdoer, ungrateful.", "And (remember) when Ibrahim said: \"O my Lord! Make this city (Makkah) one of peace and security, and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols.", "\"O my Lord! They have indeed led astray many among mankind. But whoso follows me, he verily, is of me. And whoso disobeys me, still You are indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.", "\"O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in an uncultivable valley by Your Sacred House in order, O our Lord, that they may perform Salah. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks.", "\"O our Lord! Certainly, You know what we conceal and what we reveal. Nothing on the earth or in the heaven is hidden from Allah.\"", "\"All praise is due to Allah, Who has given me in old age Isma'il and Ishaq. Verily, my Lord is indeed the All-Hearer of invocations.\"", "\"O my Lord! Make me one who performs Salah, and (also) from my offspring, our Lord! And accept my invocation.\"", "\"Our Lord! Forgive me and my parents, and (all) the believers on the Day when the reckoning will be established.\"", "Consider not that Allah is unaware of that which the wrongdoers do, but He gives them respite up to a Day when the eyes will stare in horror.", "(They will be) hastening forward with necks outstretched, their heads raised up (towards the sky), their gaze returning not towards them and their hearts empty.", "And warn mankind of the Day when the torment will come unto them; then the wrongdoers will say: \"Our Lord! Respite us for a little while, we will answer Your call and follow the Messengers!\" (It will be said:) \"Had you not sworn aforetime that you would not leave (the world for the Hereafter).\"", "\"And you dwelt in the dwellings of men who wronged themselves, and it was clear to you how We dealt with them. And We put forth (many) parables for you.\"", "Indeed, they planned their plot, and their plot was with Allah, though their plot was not such as to remove the mountains from their places.", "So think not that Allah will fail to keep His promise to His Messengers. Certainly, Allah is All-Mighty, All-Able of Retribution.", "On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they (all creatures) will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.", "And you will see the criminals that Day, Muqarranun (bound together) in fetters.", "Their garments will be of Qatiran (tar), and fire will cover their faces.", "That Allah may requite each person according to what he has earned. Truly, Allah is swift at reckoning.", "This (Qur'an) is a Message for mankind (and a clear proof against them), in order that they may be warned thereby, and that they may know that He is the only One God and that men of understanding may take heed." ] }
