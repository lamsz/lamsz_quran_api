        "Whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the earth glorifies Allah. And He is the Almighty, the All-Wise.",
        "He it is Who drove out the disbelievers among the People of the Scripture from their homes at the first gathering. You did not think that they would get out. And they thought that their fortresses would defend them from Allah! But Allah reached them from a place whereof they expected it not, and He cast terror into their hearts so that they demolished their own dwellings with their own hands and the hands of the believers. Then take admonition, O you with eyes.",
        "And had it not been that Allah had decreed exile for them, He would certainly have punished them in this world; and in the Hereafter theirs shall be the torment of the Fire.",
        "That is because they opposed Allah and His Messenger. And whosoever opposes Allah, then verily, Allah is Severe in punishment.",
        "What you cut down of the Linah, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah, and in order that He might disgrace the rebellious.",
        "And what Allah gave as booty (Fai') to His Messenger from them -- for this you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry. But Allah gives power to His Messengers over whomsoever He wills. And Allah is Able to do all things.",
        "What Allah gave as booty (Fai') to His Messenger from the people of the townships -- it is for Allah, His Messenger, the kindred, the orphans, the poor, and the wayfarer, in order that it may not become a fortune used by the rich among you. And whatsoever the Messenger gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it). And have Taqwa of Allah, verily, Allah is Severe in punishment.",
        "(And there is also a share in this booty) for the poor emigrants, who were expelled from their homes and their property, seeking bounties from Allah and (His) good pleasure, and helping Allah and His Messenger. Such are indeed the truthful.",
        "And (it is also for) those who, before them, had homes and had adopted the faith, love those who emigrate to them, and have no jealousy in their breasts for that which they have been given, and give them preference over themselves even though they were in need of that. And whosoever is saved from his own greed, such are they who will be the successful.",
        "And those who came after them say: \"Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful.",
        "Have you not observed the hypocrites who say to their disbelieving brethren among the People of the Scripture, \"If you are expelled, we indeed will go out with you, and we shall never obey anyone against you; and if you are attacked, we shall indeed help you.\" But Allah is Witness that they verily are liars.",
        "Surely, if they (the Jews) are expelled, never will they (hypocrites) go out with them; and if they are attacked, they will never help them. And (even) if they do help them, they (hypocrites) will turn their backs, and they will not be victorious.",
        "Verily, you are more fearful in their breasts than Allah. That is because they are a people who comprehend not.",
        "They fight not against you even together, except in fortified townships, or from behind walls. Their enmity among themselves is very great. You would think they were united, but their hearts are divided. That is because they are a people who understand not.",
        "They are like their immediate predecessors; they tasted the evil result of their conduct, and for them a painful torment.",
        "Like Shaytan, when he says to man: \"Disbelieve.\" But when he disbelieves, Shaytan says: \"I am free of you, I fear Allah, the Lord of all that exists!\"",
        "So, the end of both will be that they will be in the Fire, abiding therein. Such is the recompense of the wrongdoers.",
        "O you who believe! Have Taqwa of Allah and let every person look to what he has sent forth for tomorrow, and fear Allah. Verily, Allah is All-Aware of what you do.",
        "And be not like those who forgot Allah, and He caused them to forget themselves. Those are the rebellious.",
        "Not equal are the dwellers of the Fire and the dwellers of the Paradise. It is the dwellers of Paradise that will be successful.",
        "Had We sent down this Qur'an on a mountain, you would surely have seen it humbling itself and rent asunder by the fear of Allah. Such are the parables which We put forward to mankind that they may reflect.",
        "He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa, the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen. He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.",
        "He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa, Al-Malik, Al-Quddus, As-Salam, Al-Mu`min, Al-Muhaymin, Al-`Aziz, Al-Jabbar, Al-Mutakabbir. Glory be to Allah! Above all that they associate as partners with Him.",
        "He is Allah, Al-Khaliq, Al-Bari, Al-Musawwir. To Him belong the Best Names. All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify Him. And He is the Almighty, the All-Wise."
