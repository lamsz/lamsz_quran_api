And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allah, then indeed he has wronged himself. You know not, it may be that Allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass.", "Then when they are about to attain their term appointed, either take them back in a good manner or part with them in a good manner.

And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.", "And He will provide him from where he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him.

But if you make difficulties for one another, then some other woman may suckle for him.", "Let the rich man spend according to his means; and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him.
