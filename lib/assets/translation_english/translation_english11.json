        "Alif Lam Ra. (This is) a Book, the Ayat whereof are perfect (in every sphere of knowledge), and then explained in detail from One (Allah), Who is All-Wise Well-Acquainted (with all things).",
        "(Saying) worship none but Allah. Verily, I (Muhammad) am unto you from Him a warner and a bringer of glad tidings.",
        "And (commanding you): \"Seek the forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance, that He may grant you good enjoyment, for a term appointed, and bestow His abounding grace to every owner of grace. But if you turn away, then I fear for you the torment of a Great Day.",
        "To Allah is your return, and He is able to do all things.\"",
        "No doubt! They did fold up their breasts, that they may hide from Him. Surely, even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal. Verily, He is the All-Knower of the (innermost secrets) of the breasts.",
        "And no moving creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allah. And He knows its dwelling place and its deposit. All is in a Clear Book.",
        "And He it is Who has created the heavens and the earth in six Days and His Throne was over the water, that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds. But if you were to say to them: \"You shall indeed be raised up after death,\" those who disbelieve would be sure to say, \"This is nothing but obvious magic.\"",
        "And if We delay the torment for them till a determined Ummah (term), they are sure to say, \"What keeps it back\" Verily, on the day it reaches them, nothing will turn it away from them, and they will be surrounded by (or fall in) that at which they used to mock!",
        "And if We give man a taste of mercy from Us, and then withdraw it from him, verily, he is despairing, ungrateful.",
        "But if We let him taste good (favor) after evil (poverty and harm) has touched him, he is sure to say: \"Ills have departed from me.\" Surely, he is exultant and boastful (ungrateful to Allah).",
        "Except those who show patience and do righteous good deeds: those, theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward (Paradise).",
        "So perchance you may give up a part of what is revealed unto you, and that your breast feels straitened for it because they say, \"Why has not a treasure been sent down unto him, or an angel come with him\" But you are only a warner. And Allah is a Guardian over all things.",
        "Or they say, \"He forged it.\" Say: \"Bring you then ten forged Surahs like unto it, and call whomsoever you can, other than Allah, if you speak the truth!\"",
        "If then they answer you not, know then that it is sent down with the knowledge of Allah and that there is no god besides Him! Will you then be Muslims",
        "Whosoever desires the life of the world and its glitter, to them We shall pay in full (the wages of) their deeds therein, and they will have no diminution therein.",
        "They are those for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter but Fire, and vain are the deeds they did therein. And of no effect is that which they used to do.",
        "Can they who rely on a clear proof from their Lord, and whom a witness from Him recites (follows) it; and before it, came the Book of Musa, a guidance and a mercy, they believe therein, but those of the sects that reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting place. So be not in doubt about it. Verily, it is the truth from your Lord, but most of mankind believe not.",
        "And who does more wrong than he who invents a lie against Allah. Such will be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses will say,\"These are the ones who lied against their Lord!\" No doubt! The curse of Allah is on the wrongdoers.",
        "Those who hinder (others) from the path of Allah, and seek a crookedness therein, while they are disbelievers in the Hereafter.",
        "By no means will they escape on earth, nor have they protectors besides Allah! Their torment will be doubled! They could not bear to listen and they used not to see (the truth).",
        "They are those who have lost their own selves, and that which they invented eluded them.",
        "Certainly, they are those who will be the greatest losers in the Hereafter.",
        "Verily, those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and humble themselves before their Lord, they will be the dwellers of Paradise to dwell therein forever.",
        "The likeness of the two parties is as the blind and the deaf and the seer and the hearer. Are they equal when compared Will you not then take heed",
        "And indeed We sent Nuh to his people (and he said): \"I have come to you as a plain warner.\"",
        "\"That you worship none but Allah; surely, I fear for you the torment of a painful Day.\"",
        "The chiefs who disbelieved among his people said: \"We see you but a man like ourselves, nor do we see any follow you but the meanest among us and they (too) followed you without thinking. And we do not see in you any merit above us, in fact we think you are liars.\"",
        "He said: \"O my people! Tell me, if I have a clear proof from my Lord, and a mercy (prophethood) has come to me from Him, but that (mercy) has been obscured from your sight. Shall we compel you (to accept) it when you have a strong hatred for it",
        "And O my people! I ask of you no wealth for it, my reward is from none but Allah. I am not going to drive away those who have believed. Surely, they are going to meet their Lord, but I see that you are a people that are ignorant.",
        "And O my people! Who will help me against Allah, if I drove them away Will you not then give a thought",
        "And I do not say to you that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor that I know the Ghayb; nor do I say I am an angel, and I do not say of those whom your eyes look down upon that Allah will not bestow any good on them. Allah knows what is in their inner selves. In that case, I should, indeed be one of the wrongdoers.",
        "They said: \"O Nuh! You have disputed with us, and much have you prolonged the dispute with us, now bring upon us what you threaten us with, if you are of the truthful.\"",
        "He said: \"Only Allah will bring it (the punishment) on you, if He wills, and then you will escape not.",
        "\"And my advice will not profit you, even if I wish to give you good counsel, if Allah's will is to keep you astray. He is your Lord! and to Him you shall return.\"",
        "Or they (the pagans of Makkah) say: \"He has fabricated it.\" Say: \"If I have fabricated it, upon me be my crimes, but I am innocent of (all) those crimes which you commit.",
        "And it was revealed to Nuh: \"None of your people will believe except those who have believed already. So be not sad because of what they used to do.",
        "\"And construct the ship under Our Eyes and with Our revelation, and address Me not on behalf of those who did wrong; they are surely to be drowned.\"",
        "And as he was constructing the ship, whenever the chiefs of his people passed by him, they mocked at him. He said: \"If you mock at us, so do we mock at you likewise for your mocking.\"",
        "\"And you will know who it is on whom will come a torment that will cover him with disgrace and on whom will fall a lasting torment.\"",
        "(So it was) till when Our command came and the oven gushed forth (water like fountains from the earth). We said: \"Embark therein, of each kind two (male and female), and your family -- except him against whom the Word has already gone forth -- and those who believe. And none believed with him, except a few.\"",
        "And he said: \"Embark therein: in the Name of Allah will be its (moving) course and its (resting) anchorage. Surely, my Lord is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\"",
        "So it (the ship) sailed with them amidst waves like mountains, and Nuh called out to his son, who had separated himself (apart): \"O my son! Embark with us and be not with the disbelievers.\"",
        "The son replied: \"I will betake myself to some mountain, it will save me from the water.\" Nuh said: \"This day there is no savior from the decree of Allah except him on whom He has mercy.\" And waves came in between them, so he (the son) was among the drowned.",
        "And it was said: \"O earth! Swallow up your water, and O sky! Withhold (your rain).\" And the water was made to subside and the decree was fulfilled. And it rested on (Mount) Judi, and it was said: \"Away with the people who are wrongdoing!\"",
        "And Nuh called upon his Lord and said, \"O my Lord! Verily, my son is of my family! And certainly, Your promise is true, and You are the Most Just of the judges.\"",
        "He said: \"O Nuh! Surely, he is not of your family; verily, his work is unrighteous, so ask not of Me that of which you have no knowledge! I admonish you, lest you should be one of the ignorant.\"",
        "Nuh said: \"O my Lord! I seek refuge with You from asking You that of which I have no knowledge. And unless You forgive me and have mercy on me, I would indeed be one of the losers.\"",
        "It was said: \"O Nuh! Come down (from the ship) with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the people who are with you (and on some of their offspring), but (there will be other) people to whom We shall grant their pleasures (for a time), but in the end a painful torment will reach them from Us.\"",
        "This is of the news of the Unseen which We reveal unto you; neither you nor your people knew it before this. So be patient. Surely, the (good) end is for those who have Taqwa.",
        "And to the `Ad (people We sent) their brother Hud. He said, \"O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other god but Him. Certainly, you do nothing but invent lies!",
        "\"O my people I ask of you no reward for it (the Message). My reward is only from Him Who created me. Will you not then understand\"",
        "\"And O my people! Ask forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him, He will send you (from the sky) abundant rain, and add strength to your strength, so do not turn away as criminals.\"",
        "They said: \"O Hud! No evidence have you brought us, and we shall not leave our gods for your (mere) saying! And we are not believers in you.",
        "All that we say is that some of our gods (false deities) have seized you with evil (madness). He said: \"I call Allah to witness and bear you witness that I am free from that which you ascribe as partners in worship,",
        "Besides Him (Allah). So plot against me, all of you, and give me no respite.\"",
        "I put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord! There is not a moving creature but He has the grasp of its forelock. Verily, my Lord is on the straight path (the truth).",
        "So if you turn away, still I have conveyed the Message with which I was sent to you. My Lord will make another people succeed you, and you will not harm Him in the least. Surely, my Lord is Guardian over all things.",
        "And when Our commandment came, We saved Hud and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us, and We saved them from a severe torment.",
        "Such were [the people of] `Ad. They rejected the Ayat of their Lord and disobeyed His Messengers, and followed the command of every proud, obstinate (oppressor of the truth from their leaders).",
        "And they were pursued by a curse in this world and (so they will be) on the Day of Resurrection. No doubt! Verily, `Ad disbelieved in their Lord. So away with `Ad, the people of Hud.",
        "And to Thamud (people We sent) their brother Salih. He said: \"O my people! Worship Allah: you have no other god but Him. He brought you forth from the earth and settled you therein, then ask forgiveness of Him and turn to Him in repentance. Certainly, my Lord is Near (to all by His knowledge), Responsive.\"",
        "They said: \"O Salih! You have been among us as a figure of good hope until this! Do you (now) forbid us the worship of what our fathers have worshipped But we are really in grave doubt as to that to which you invite us.\"",
        "He said: \"O my people! Tell me, if I have a clear proof from my Lord, and there has come to me a mercy from Him, who then can help me against Allah, if I were to disobey Him Then you increase me not but in loss.\"",
        "\"And O my people! This she-camel of Allah is a sign to you, so leave her to graze in Allah's land, and touch her not with evil, lest a near torment should seize you.\"",
        "But they slaughtered her. So he said: \"Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days. This is a promise (a threat) that will not be belied.\"",
        "So when Our commandment came, We saved Salih and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us, and from the disgrace of that Day. Verily, your Lord -- He is the All-Strong, the All-Mighty.",
        "And As-Sayhah (awful cry) overtook the wrongdoers, so they lay (dead), prostrate in their homes.",
        "As if they had never lived there. No doubt! Verily, Thamud disbelieved in their Lord. So away with Thamud!",
        "And verily, there came Our messengers to Ibrahim with the glad tidings. They said: \"Salaman (greetings or peace!)\" He answered, \"Salamun (greetings or peace!),\" and he hastened to entertain them with a roasted calf.",
        "But when he saw their hands went not towards it (the meal), he mistrusted them, and conceived a fear of them. They said: \"Fear not, we have been sent against the people of Lut.\"",
        "And his wife was standing (there), and she laughed. But We gave her glad tidings of Ishaq, and after Ishaq, of Ya`qub.",
        "She said (in astonishment): \"Woe unto me! Shall I bear a child while I am an old woman, and here is my husband an old man Verily, this is a strange thing!\"",
        "They said: \"Do you wonder at the decree of Allah The mercy of Allah and His blessings be on you, O the family [of Ibrahim]. Surely, He (Allah) is All-Praiseworthy, All-Glorious.\"",
        "Then when the fear had gone away from (the mind of) Ibrahim, and the glad tidings had reached him, he began to plead with Us (Our messengers) for the people of Lut.",
        "Verily, Ibrahim was, without doubt, forbearing, used to invoke Allah with humility, and was repentant.",
        "\"O Ibrahim! Forsake this. Indeed, the commandment of your Lord has gone forth. Verily, there will come a torment for them which cannot be turned back.\"",
        "And when Our messengers came to Lut, he was grieved on account of them and was concerned for them. He said: \"This is a distressful day.\"",
        "And his people came rushing towards him, and since aforetime they used to commit crimes, he said: \"O my people! Here are my daughters, they are purer for you. So have Taqwa of Allah and disgrace me not with regard to my guests! Is there not among you a single right-minded man\"",
        "They said: \"Surely, you know that we have no need of your daughters, and indeed you know well what we want!\"",
        "He said: \"Would that I had strength to overpower you, or that I could betake myself to some powerful support.\"",
        "They (messengers) said: \"O Lut! Verily, we are the messengers from your Lord! They shall not reach you! So travel with your family in a part of the night, and let not any of you look back; but your wife (will remain behind), verily, the punishment which will afflict them, will afflict her. Indeed, morning is their appointed time. Is not the morning near\"",
        "So when Our commandment came, We turned them upside down, and rained on them stones of clay, in an array.",
        "Marked from your Lord; and they are not ever far from the wrongdoers.",
        "And to the Madyan people (We sent) their brother Shu`ayb. He said: \"O my people! Worship Allah, you have no other god but Him, and give not short measure or weight. I see you in prosperity and verily, I fear for you the torment of a Day encompassing.\"",
        "\"And O my people! Give full measure and weight in justice and reduce not the things that are due to the people, and do not commit mischief in the land, causing corruption.\"",
        "\"That which is left by Allah is better for you, if you are believers. And I am not a guardian over you.\"",
        "They said: \"O Shu`ayb! Does your Salah command you that we give up what our fathers used to worship, or that we give up doing what we like with our property Verily, you are the forbearer, right-minded!\"",
        "He said: \"O my people! Tell me if I have a clear evidence from my Lord and He has given me a good sustenance from Himself (shall I corrupt it by mixing it with the unlawfully earned money). I wish not, in contradiction to you, to do that which I forbid you. I only desire reform to the best of my power. And my guidance cannot come except from Allah, in Him I put my trust and unto Him I repent.\"",
        "\"And O my people! Let not my Shiqaq cause you to suffer the fate similar to that of the people of Nuh or of Hud or of Salih, and the people of Lut are not far off from you!\"",
        "\"And ask forgiveness of your Lord and turn unto Him in repentance. Verily, my Lord is Most Merciful, Most Loving.\"",
        "They said: \"O Shu`ayb! We do not understand much of what you say, and we see you weak among us. Were it not for your family, you would have been stoned, and you are not powerful against us.\"",
        "He said: \"O my people! Is then my family of more weight with you than Allah And you have cast Him away behind your backs. Verily, my Lord is surrounding all that you do.\"",
        "\"And O my people! Act according to your ability, and I am acting. You will come to know who it is on whom descends the torment that will cover him with ignominy, and who is a liar! And watch you! Verily, I too am watching with you.\"",
        "And when Our commandment came, We saved Shu`ayb and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us. And As-Sayhah (awful cry) seized the wrongdoers, and they lay (Jathimin) in their homes.",
        "As if they had never lived there! So away with Madyan just as Thamud went away!",
        "And indeed We sent Musa with Our Ayat and a manifest authority.",
        "To Fir`awn and his chiefs, but they followed the command of Fir`awn, and the command of Fir`awn was no right guide.",
        "He will go ahead of his people on the Day of Resurrection, and will lead them into the Fire, and evil indeed is the place to which they are led.",
        "They were pursued by a curse in this (deceiving life of this world) and (so they will be pursued by a curse) on the Day of Resurrection, evil indeed is the gift granted.",
        "That is some of the news of the (population of) towns which We relate unto you; of them, some are (still) standing, and some have been (already) reaped.",
        "We wronged them not, but they wronged themselves. So their gods whom they call upon besides Allah, profited them naught when there came the command of your Lord, nor did they add aught to them but destruction.",
        "Such is the punishment of your Lord when He seizes the (population of) towns while they are doing wrong. Verily, His punishment is painful (and) severe.",
        "Indeed in that (there) is a sure lesson for those who fear the torment of the Hereafter. That is a Day whereon mankind will be gathered together, and that is a Day when all will be present.",
        "And We delay it only for a term (already) fixed.",
        "On the Day when it comes, no person shall speak except by His (Allah's) leave. Some among them will be wretched and (others) blessed.",
        "As for those who are wretched, they will be in the Fire, in it they will experience Zafir and Shahiq.",
        "They will dwell therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord wills. Verily, your Lord is the doer of whatsoever He intends (or wills).",
        "And those who are blessed, they will be in Paradise, abiding therein for all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord wills: a gift without an end.",
        "So be not in doubt as to what these people (pagans and polytheists) worship. They worship nothing but what their fathers worshipped before (them). And verily, We shall repay them in full their portion without diminution.",
        "Indeed, We gave the Book to Musa, but differences arose therein, and had it not been for a Word that had gone forth before from your Lord, the case would have been judged between them, and indeed they are in grave doubt concerning it (this Qur'an).",
        "And verily, to each of them your Lord will repay their works in full. Surely, He is All-Aware of what they do.",
        "So stand (ask Allah to make) you firm and straight as you are commanded and those who turn in repentance with you, and transgress not. Verily, He is All-Seer of what you do.",
        "And incline not toward those who do wrong, lest the Fire should touch you, and you have no protectors other than Allah, nor would you then be helped.",
        "And perform the Salah, at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds. That is a reminder for the mindful.",
        "And be patient; verily, Allah wastes not the reward of the doers of good.",
        "If only there had been among the generations before you persons having wisdom, prohibiting (others) from Fasad (corruption) in the earth, except a few of those whom We saved from among them! Those who did wrong pursued the enjoyment of good things of (this worldly) life, and were criminals.",
        "And your Lord would never destroy the towns wrongfully, while their people were doers of good.",
        "And if your Lord had so willed, He could surely have made mankind one Ummah, but they will not cease to disagree.",
        "Except him on whom your Lord has bestowed His mercy, and for that did He create them. And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled (His saying): \"Surely, I shall fill Hell with Jinn and men all together.\"",
        "And all that We relate to you of the news of the Messengers is in order that We may make strong and firm your heart thereby. And in this has come to you the truth, as well as an admonition and a reminder for the believers.",
        "And say to those who do not believe: \"Act according to your ability and way, We are acting.",
        "And you wait! We (too) are waiting.\"",
        "And to Allah belongs the Ghayb of the heavens and the earth, and to Him return all affairs (for decision). So worship Him and put your trust in Him. And your Lord is not unaware of what you (people) do."
