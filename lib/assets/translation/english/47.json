{ "id": 47, "name": "محمد","translation":"Muhammad", "ayaTranslation": [ "Those who disbelieve and hinder (men) from the path of Allah, He will render their deeds vain.", "But those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and believe in that which is sent down to Muhammad -- for it is the truth from their Lord -- He expiates from them their sins and amends their Bal.", "That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood, while those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. Thus does Allah set forth for mankind their parables.", "So, when you meet those who disbelieve (in battle), smite (their) necks until you have fully defeated them, then tighten their bonds. Thereafter (is the time) either for generosity or ransom, until the war lays down its burden. Thus, and had Allah so willed, He could have taken vengeance against them;--but (He lets you struggle) so as to test with one another. But those who are killed in the way of Allah, He will never let their deeds be lost.", "He will guide them and amend their condition.", "And admit them to Paradise, which He has made known to them.", "O you who believe! If you support (in the cause of) Allah, He will support you, and make your foothold firm.", "But as for those who disbelieve, misery awaits them, and (Allah) will make their deeds vain.", "That is because they hate that which Allah has sent down; so He has made their deeds fruitless.", "Have they not traveled through the earth and seen what happened in the end to those before them Allah destroyed them completely, and a similar (awaits) the disbelievers.", "That is because Allah is the Protector of those who believe, whereas the disbelievers have no protector.", "Certainly Allah will admit those who believe and do righteous good deeds, into Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise); while those who disbelieve enjoy their life and eat as cattle eat; but the Fire will be their abode.", "And how many a town mightier than your town that has driven you out We have destroyed, with none to help them!", "Can then he, who stands on clear evidence from his Lord, be like those for whom their evil deeds are beautified for them, while they follow their own lusts", "The description of Paradise which is promised to those who have Taqwa, (is that) in it are rivers of water that are not Asin, rivers of milk the taste of which never changes, rivers of wine delicious to those who drink it, and rivers of refined honey; and therein for them are all kinds of fruits, and forgiveness from their Lord. Can this be likened to those who abide eternally in the Fire and are given to drink boiling water that severs their intestines", "And among them are some who listen to you till when they go out from you, they say to those who have received knowledge: \"What is it that he has said just now \"Such are men whose hearts Allah has sealed because they followed their lusts.", "And as for those who accept guidance, He increases them in guidance and bestows on them their Taqwa.", "Do they then await except that the Hour should come upon them suddenly But already there have come (some of) its portents; and when it (actually) is on them, how can they benefit then by their reminder", "So know that La ilaha illallah and ask forgiveness for your sin, and also for (the sin of) believing men and women. And Allah knows well your moving about, and your place of rest.", "Those who believe say: \"Why is not a Surah sent down (for us)\" But now that a decisive Surah is sent down mentioning fighting, you can see those in whose hearts is disease (of hypocrisy) looking at you with the look of one who is about to faint for fear of death. But it was better for them.", "Obedience and good words. And when the matter is resolved, then if they had been true to Allah, it would have been better for them.", "So would you perhaps, if you turned away, spread corruption on earth, and sever your ties of kinship", "Such are the ones whom Allah has cursed, so that He has made them deaf and blinded their vision.", "Will they not then reflect upon the Qur'an, or are there locks upon their hearts", "Verily, those who have turned back as disbelievers after guidance had become clear to them -- Shaytan has enticed them and filled them with false hopes.", "That is because they said to those who hate what Allah has sent down: \"We will obey you in part of the matter.\" And Allah knows their secrets.", "Then how (will it be) when the angels will take their souls at death, striking their faces and their backs", "That is because they followed that which angered Allah and hated what earns His pleasure, so He rendered their deeds worthless.", "Or do those in whose hearts is a disease, think that Allah will not expose their ill--wills", "Had We so willed, We could have shown them clearly to you, so that you would know them by their marks; but you will know them by the tone of their speech! And Allah knows (all) your deeds.", "And We will surely, try you until We know those who strive among you and the patient, and We will put to a test all your affairs.", "Verily, those who disbelieve, and hinder from the path of Allah, and oppose the Messenger, after the guidance has been clearly shown to them, they will not harm Allah in the least, but He will make their deeds fruitless,", "O you who believe! Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger and invalidate not your deeds.", "Verily, those who disbelieved and obstructed others from the path of Allah and then died as disbelievers -- never will Allah not forgive them.", "So do not lose heart and beg for peace while you are superior. Allah is with you and He will never deprive you of (the reward of) your deeds.", "This worldly life is only amusement and diversion. And if you believe and have Taqwa of Allah, He will grant you your rewards, and will not ask from you (to sacrifice all of) your possessions.", "If He would demand of you all of it and urge you, you would withhold. And He will expose your (secret) ill--wills.", "Here you are now invited to spend in Allah's cause; but among you are those who withhold (stingily). And whoever acts stingily is but stingy toward himself. For Allah is indeed free of needs, while you are the needy. And if you turn away, He will replace you with other people; then they will not be like you." ] }
