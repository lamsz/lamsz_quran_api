The promise of Allah is true. It is He Who begins the creation and then will repeat it, that He may reward with justice those who believed and did deeds of righteousness.

So We leave those who expect not their meeting with Us, in their trespasses, wandering blindly in distraction.", "And when harm touches man, he invokes Us, lying on his side, or sitting or standing. But when We have removed his harm from him, he passes on as if he had never invoked Us for a harm that touched him! Thus it is made fair seeming to the wasteful that which they used to do.", "And indeed, We destroyed generations before you when they did wrong, while their Messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they were not such as to believe! Thus do We requite the people who are criminals.", "Then We made you successors after them, generations after generations in the land, that We might see how you would work.", "And when Our clear Ayat are recited unto them, those who hope not for their meeting with Us, say: \"Bring us a Qur'an other than this, or change it.\" Say: \"It is not for me to change it on my own accord; I only follow that which is revealed unto me.
