The day that some of the signs of your Lord do come, no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before, nor earned good with his faith. Say: \"Wait you! We (too) are waiting.\"", "Verily, those who divide their religion and break up into sects, you have no concern with them in the least. Their affair is only with Allah, Who then will tell them what they used to do.", "Whoever brings a good deed shall have ten times the like thereof to his credit, and whoever brings an evil deed shall have only the recompense of the like thereof, and they will not be wronged.", "Say: \"Truly, my Lord has guided me to a straight path, a right religion, the religion of Ibrahim, Hanifan (monotheism) and he was not of the Mushrikin.\"", "Say: \"Verily, my Salah, my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of all that exists.\"", "\"He has no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims.\"", "Say: \"Shall I seek a lord other than Allah, while He is the Lord of all things No person earns any (sin) except against himself (only), and no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another. Then unto your Lord is your return, so He will tell you that wherein you have been differing.\"", "And it is He Who has made you generations coming after generations, replacing each other on the earth. And He has raised you in ranks, some above others that He may try you in that which He has bestowed on you. Surely, your Lord is Swift in retribution, and certainly He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful." ] }
