But you do not honor the orphan","And you do not encourage one another to feed the poor.","And you consume inheritance, devouring [it] altogether,","And you love wealth with immense love.","No! When the earth has been leveled - pounded and crushed -","And your Lord has come and the angels, rank upon rank,","And brought [within view], that Day, is Hell - that Day, man will remember, but what good to him will be the remembrance?","He will say, \"Oh, I wish I had sent ahead [some good] for my life.\"","So on that Day, none will punish [as severely] as His punishment,","And none will bind [as severely] as His binding [of the evildoers].","[To the righteous it will be said], \"O reassured soul,","Return to your Lord, well-pleased and pleasing [to Him],","And enter among My [righteous] servants","And enter My Paradise.\""],"id":89,"translation":"Shaheeh International","name":"الفجر"}
