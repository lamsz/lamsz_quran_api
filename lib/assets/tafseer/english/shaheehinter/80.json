{"ayaTranslation":["The Prophet frowned and turned away","Because there came to him the blind man, [interrupting].","But what would make you perceive, [O Muhammad], that perhaps he might be purified","Or be reminded and the remembrance would benefit him?","As for he who thinks himself without need,","To him you give attention.","And not upon you [is any blame] if he will not be purified.","But as for he who came to you striving [for knowledge]","While he fears [Allah],","From him you are distracted.","No! Indeed, these verses are a reminder;","So whoever wills may remember it.","[It is recorded] in honored sheets,","Exalted and purified,","[Carried] by the hands of messenger-angels,","Noble and dutiful.","Cursed is man; how disbelieving is he.","From what substance did He create him?","From a sperm-drop He created him and destined for him;","Then He eased the way for him;","Then He causes his death and provides a grave for him.","Then when He wills, He will resurrect him.","No! Man has not yet accomplished what He commanded him.","Then let mankind look at his food -","How We poured down water in torrents,","Then We broke open the earth, splitting [it with sprouts],","And caused to grow within it grain","And grapes and herbage","And olive and palm trees","And gardens of dense shrubbery","And fruit and grass -","[As] enjoyment for you and your grazing livestock.","But when there comes the Deafening Blast","On the Day a man will flee from his brother","And his mother and his father","And his wife and his children,","For every man, that Day, will be a matter adequate for him.","[Some] faces, that Day, will be bright -","Laughing, rejoicing at good news.","And [other] faces, that Day, will have upon them dust.","Blackness will cover them.","Those are the disbelievers, the wicked ones."],"id":80,"translation":"Shaheeh International","name":"عبس"}
