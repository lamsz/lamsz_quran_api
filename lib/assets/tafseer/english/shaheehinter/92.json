{"ayaTranslation":["By the night when it covers","And [by] the day when it appears","And [by] He who created the male and female,","Indeed, your efforts are diverse.","As for he who gives and fears Allah","And believes in the best [reward],","We will ease him toward ease.","But as for he who withholds and considers himself free of need","And denies the best [reward],","We will ease him toward difficulty.","And what will his wealth avail him when he falls?","Indeed, [incumbent] upon Us is guidance.","And indeed, to Us belongs the Hereafter and the first [life].","So I have warned you of a Fire which is blazing.","None will [enter to] burn therein except the most wretched one.","Who had denied and turned away.","But the righteous one will avoid it -","[He] who gives [from] his wealth to purify himself","And not [giving] for anyone who has [done him] a favor to be rewarded","But only seeking the countenance of his Lord, Most High.","And he is going to be satisfied."],"id":92,"translation":"Shaheeh International","name":"الليل"}
