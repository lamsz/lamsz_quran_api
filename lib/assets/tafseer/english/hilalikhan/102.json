    "The mutual rivalry for piling up of worldly things diverts you,",
    "Until you visit the graves (i.e. till you die).",

    "Again, Nay! You shall come to know!",
    "Nay! If you knew with a sure knowledge (the end result of piling up, you would not have occupied yourselves in worldly things)",
    "Verily, You shall see the blazing Fire (Hell)!",
