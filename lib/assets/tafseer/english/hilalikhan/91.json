Fear the evil end. That is the she-camel of Allah! (Do not harm it) and bar it not from having its drink!\"","Then they denied him and they killed it. So their Lord destroyed them because of their sin, and made them equal in destruction (i.e. all grades of people, rich and poor, strong and weak, etc.)!","And He (Allah) feared not the consequences thereof."]}
