    "The Reality (i.e. the Day of Resurrection)!",
    "What is the Reality?",
    "And what will make you know what the Reality is?",
    "Thamud and 'Ad people denied the Qari'ah [the striking Hour (of Judgement)]!",
    "As for Thamud, they were destroyed by the awful cry!",
    "And as for 'Ad, they were destroyed by a furious violent wind;",
    "Which Allah imposed on them for seven nights and eight days in succession, so that you could see men lying overthrown (destroyed), as if they were hollow trunks of date-palms!",
    "Do you see any remnants of them?",
    "And Fir'aun (Pharaoh), and those before him, and the cities overthrown [the towns of the people of [Lout (Lot)] committed sin,",
    "And they disobeyed their Lord's Messenger, so He punished them with a strong punishment.",
    "Verily! When the water rose beyond its limits [Nuh's (Noah) Flood], We carried you (mankind) in the floating [ship that was constructed by Nuh (Noah)].",
    "That We might make it a remembrance for you, and the keen ear (person) may (hear and) understand it.",
    "Then when the Trumpet will be blown with one blowing (the first one),",
    "And the earth and the mountains shall be removed from their places, and crushed with a single crushing,",
    "Then on that Day shall the (Great) Event befall,",
    "And the heaven will split asunder, for that Day it (the heaven will be frail (weak), and torn up,",
    "And the angels will be on its sides, and eight angels will, that Day, bear the Throne of your Lord above them.",
    "That Day shall you be brought to Judgement, not a secret of you will be hidden.",
    "Then as for him who will be given his Record in his right hand will say: \"Take, read my Record!",
    "\"Surely, I did believe that I shall meet my Account!\"",
    "So he shall be in a life, well-pleasing.",
    "In a lofty Paradise,",
    "The fruits in bunches whereof will be low and near at hand.",

    "\"Then fasten him with a chain whereof the length is seventy cubits!\"",
    "Verily, He used not to believe in Allah, the Most Great,",
    "And urged not on the feeding of Al-Miskin (the poor),",

    "Nor any food except filth from the washing of wounds,",
    "None will eat except the Khati'un (sinners, disbelievers, polytheists, etc.).",
    "So I swear by whatsoever you see,",
    "And by whatsoever you see not,",
    "That this is verily the word of an honoured Messenger [i.e. Jibrael (Gabriel) or Muhammad SAW which he has brought from Allah].",
    "It is not the word of a poet, little is that you believe!",
    "Nor is it the word of a soothsayer (or a foreteller), little is that you remember!",
    "This is the Revelation sent down from the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that exists).",
    "And if he (Muhammad SAW) had forged a false saying concerning Us (Allah),",
    "We surely should have seized him by his right hand (or with power and might),",
    "And then certainly should have cut off his life artery (Aorta),",
    "And none of you could withhold Us from (punishing) him.",
    "And verily, this Quran is a Reminder for the Muttaqun (pious - see V. 2:2).",
    "And verily, We know that there are some among you that belie (this Quran). [Tafsir At-Tabari, Vol. 29, Page 68]",

    "And Verily, it (this Quran) is an absolute truth with certainty.",
    "So glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most Great."
