    "Verily! We have sent it (this Quran) down in the night of Al-Qadr (Decree)",
    "And what will make you know what the night of Al-Qadr (Decree) is?",
    "The night of Al-Qadr (Decree) is better than a thousand months (i.e. worshipping Allah in that night is better than worshipping Him a thousand months, (i.e. 83 years and 4 months).",
    "Therein descend the angels and the Ruh [Jibrael (Gabriel)] by Allah's Permission with all Decrees,",
    "Peace! (All that night, there is Peace and Goodness from Allah to His believing slaves) until the appearance of dawn."
